A formula sheet (`uo-official-cheat-sheet.pdf`) as well as a whole year cheet sheet (`cs.tex / cs.pdf`)

The official one looks weird since it has to follow strict guidelines

Disclaimer
> I really have no idea what I am doing for this course, I know the basics and how to do the examples from just doing example after example, but the actual theory does not fully make sense to me. So if this cheat sheet is a pile of nonsense, so be it :-)
