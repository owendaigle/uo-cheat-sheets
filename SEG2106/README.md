This is not going to be a good one since this course is easy and not really something I can easily make into a cheat sheet. So it will be more of an outline of the course probably

edit:
yes agree with what I said eariler
it is not a full fleshed out with examples, since the examples are long, and mostly diagrams. they are done in my assignments though.

specifically:
- ass1: petri nets and uml class diagram (100%)
- ass2: regex and nfa/dfa (98% since typo in final petri net, supposed to be not alive and unbounded as explained in notes)
- ass3: syntax analysis (100%)
- ass4: concurrency (100%)
