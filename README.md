# uo-cheat-sheets

> I should really change what these are called, since they are really not **cheat sheets** since I never have, never will, and don't think anyone ever should, cheat. They are really just summary sheets. Also, who is going to smuggle in 15 pages of notes... 

just some cheat sheets I made for university, not all are here atm, but I hope to get all of mine as well as the source in this repo

different courses are stored in different directories,

ignore the names, they might be called midterm 1 cheat sheet but not actually for m1, i am just lazy to change the name and have to refactor my env

and obv while called cheet sheet, **do not cheat using these,** *they are more of a 'summary sheet' for ref*

My grades for the courses are found in file called `grades.md` in each directory. This is just so if you are looking at one of these sheets you can gauge how much to trust it or not.

# DISCLAIMER

I am a **student**. I am not an expert in any of these fields. So some of the information **may and probably is** wrong or misleading. I try my best to make it all correct, but as I mentioned, I am a **student** who does this in their free time. If you think there is an error, ask your instructor. If you just blindly agree with what I say, write a test using this information, and then upon doing poorly complain to your professor that "some random person on the internet, they said I should do it this way", that will not go well for you.

# licence

do (literally) whatever you want with this, but i take no responsability for errors or anything in this. if you come screaming at me because my sheet said to do something which you did on a test and failed because of that, i will laugh at you. these are made by me for me, this repo is just so i can easily access these. in fact i know some of the information is wrong but am too lazy to go back and fix it. so be warned.

i am not an expert in any of these fields, so there may (will) be errors. you are free to submit a pr or fork the repo though to fix something if you want. 

# extra

all of this was learned at uottawa often using textbooks. many examples taken from textbooks or professors notes. i dont think i have anything copywrited, but i am not a lawyer, so lmk if something is wrong, i will get it sorted.
