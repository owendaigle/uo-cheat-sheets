# uo-cheat-sheets

just some cheat sheets I made for university, not all are here atm, but I hope to get all of mine as well as the source in this repo

different courses are stored in different directories,

ignore the names, they might be called midterm 1 cheat sheet but not actually for m1, i am just lazy to change the name and have to refactor my env

and obv while called cheet sheet, **do not cheat using these,** *they are more of a 'summary sheet' for ref*

# licence

do (literally) whatever you want with this, but i take no responsability for errors or anything in this. if you come screaming at me because my sheet said to do something which you did on a test and failed because of that, i will laugh at you. these are made by me for me, this repo is just so i can easily access these.

i am not an expert in any of these fields, so there may (will) be errors. you are free to submit a pr or fork the repo though to fix something if you want. 

# extra

all of this was learned at uottawa often using textbooks. many examples taken from textbooks or professors notes. i dont think i have anything copywrited, but i am not a lawyer, so lmk if something is wrong, i will get it sorted.
