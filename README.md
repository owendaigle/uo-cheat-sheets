# uo-cheat-sheets

just some cheat sheets I made for university, not all are here atm, but I hope to get all of mine as well as the source in this repo

different courses are stored in different branches,

ignore the names, they might be called midterm 1 cheat sheet but not actually for m1, i am just lazy to change the name and have to refactor my env

and obv while called cheet sheet, do not cheat using these, they are more of a 'summary sheet' for ref

# licence

do (literally) whatever you want with this, but i take no responsability for errors or anything in this. if you come screaming at me because my sheet said to do something which you did on a test and failed because of that, i will laugh at you. these are made by me for me, this repo is just so i can easily access these.
