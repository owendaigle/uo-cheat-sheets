	\section{Summary}
	\subsection{Greeks}
	Greeks thing of technology as something that imitates nature. Weaving and house building were created by imitating spiders and swallows building nets and nests. 

	Technology is a genuine mechanical knowledge such as how farmers know how to work the land, and shoemakers know how to work with wood and other materials. This is known as Techne. Episteme is the theoretical knowledge about techne. 

	They organized science into multiple categories such as Logic, Science and Philosophy, Ethics and Politics, and Art and Technology.

	The Greeks thought of nature (physis) as a divine law. They thought that everything done according to nature (or with technology since that perfects nature) is divine. Technology can only seek to perfect nature by altering it to meet human needs and to be useful. 
	
	
	\subsection{What is Technology}
	When coming up with a definition the definition should not be too broad or narrow, it should not be circular, it should not use figurative language or metaphors, and it should be in positive terms. 
	
	Technology can be defined as tools or machines. These items are concrete, and easily understandable. This definition however does not include things such as physiologist tools, which are technology. 
	
	Technology can also be defined as a pattern of rule following behavior. This treats technology as rules rather than tools. Technology is a pattern that is systematically developed. This will include psychology, and software. 
	
	
	\subsection{Francis Bacon}

	Bacon is the founder of the modern inductive scientific method where we observe something, and come up with a rule to explain that something. This is done systematically. 
	
	The human mind has a lot of problems, it has 4 main biasses in which it sees the world. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Idol of the tribe means that we are biased due to human nature, we want to have order and regularity, and we are influenced by emotions. 
	\item Idol of the cave are illusions of the individual person, a single person thinks the whole world is similar to this person and thinks in the same way.
	\item Idol of the marketplace is about language barriers such as words that have complex or abstract meanings, and miscommunication. 
	\item Idols of the theater are about superstitions.
	\end{itemize}

	Bacon thought that humans should dominate and control nature. We however need to do this by obeying the laws of nature. Humans are superior to nature. 

The final goal of humans is to create a new reality. 

	Bacon wanted to reform the education system to take precaution against the idols.
	
	
	\subsection{August Compte}
	He introduced and popularized positive philosophy. It is about knowledge that is testable, and verified. 
	
	He said that there were three stages in humanities development. Theological stage (Sacred Text), Metaphysical stage (Theoretical Reason), and Scientific stage (Experimentation and Observation). The first stage is dominated by military, the second stage dominated by churches, and lawyers, and the third stage by industrial institutions and science. Individual human knowledge also follows these three stages. 
	
	Sociology is the end of the scientific (positive) method. All other sciences build up to it. 

	He believes that the fragmentation of science is not a good thing, they should not be split up into all the different stages. We should focus on one general specialty that studies the general scientific traits 
	Comte wanted to reform the education system with sociology.
	
	
	\subsection{Jean Jacque Rousseau}
	Rousseau valued freedom, he considers technology as removing freedom. Humans are increasingly dependent on one another for their satisfaction of their needs. 

	Humans are naturally good, a human in nature would be free and be good. Civilization corrupted the humans by forcing them to compete for things such as food, and water. Since humans have to fight other people for this in a society with technology, they will steal and kill. 

	Science adds luxury and leisure which do not improve the moral well being. Luxury is needed to feed the poor people, but if there was no luxury, then there would be no poor people. 
	
	
	\subsection{Jacques Ellul}
	Continental philosophy of technology tends to criticize technology, this is what Ellul studies. 

	There are 7 main characteristics of technology. Rationality, artificiality, automatism, self-augmentation, wholeness, universalism, and autonomy.

	Technology is meant to create efficiency. This can take away from the thing that makes people human. It is created for the modern world, but it is not a good fit for society. Technology has outgrown human control, we are not able to understand or govern all these individual technologies. 

	Technique is the prime mover of all the rest of the change such as social change, and political change. Technology is autonomous, it will keep marching forward even without humans. It is its own system with its own laws, outside of human values. 

	Ellul believes that the world is deterministic. Freedom is dynamic, and humans must continue to be determined to be free. 

	He believes that everything now is rooted in technique. Even sports use technology which reduces freedom, and gives deterministic results.

	He does not want to eliminate technology, but wants to raise awareness and make it known that individuals have a responsibility to be aware of technology’s flaws. 
	
	
	\subsection{Mario Bunge}
	There are two types of philosophy of technology. The rationalist view (Continental philosophy of technology) has a critical view of technology. The empiricism view (Analytic philosophy of technology) has a more positive view of technology. Mario Bunge has an analytic view, he views a very strong connection between technology and philosophy. He thinks this because of the three main pillars of philosophy which are metaphysical, ethical, and epistemological. 
	
	We can talk about technology in all three of these lenses:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Metaphysical: The world is composed of things in systems. These things and systems follow laws. 
		\item Ethical: Technology can be used to kill people.
		\item Epistemological: There is an external world tat can be known. Everything in this external world can be improved upon if we want to. 
	\end{itemize}

	Technology and philosophy are not opposites, they work well together and influence each other. 
	
	Bunge separates technology and science. Technology aims to find the truth for useful problems, while science aims to find the truth for the sake of science. Science is pure and neutral. It just aims to find the truth whether good or bad. Technology introduces values so it could be good or bad. Think of nuclear bombs, the science is the nuclear reactions. This is neither good or bad. But the technology is the actual taking the science and creating a bomb to kill people which is probably a bad thing. 

	There is a philosophical input and output to technology. We can see that culture and society affects technology, but conversely technology also affects culture and society. 

	Bunge argues that philosophy of technology is a subdicipline of philosophy of science. 
	
	
	\subsection{Vienna Circle}

	These people came up with the theory of logical positivism which basically rejected everything except for purely scientific methods. Everything else was meaningless. They thought that metaphysics uses too much language, and logic is the only valid part. This contains concepts, arguments, and propositions. 

	Scientific realism means that an object exists outside of the mind, propositions must be true or false, and arguments must be valid. 

	For a statement, it can either be A Priory (Analytic) or A Posteriori (Synthetic). A Priori means we can know without any experience, just based on prior knowledge such as “Tomorrow it will rain or not rain”. A Posterior means we need to experience in order to know if it is true or not such as “Tomorrow it will rain”. We don’t know if that is true or not without waiting till tomorrow, going outside, and seeing if it is raining or not. Logical positism groups this into two boxes. A posteriory synthetic, and A priory analytic. Other philosophers seperate synthetic and a posteriory and A priory and analytic. The difference is the A posteriori and A priory are epistemological distinctions, while analytic and synthetic are semantic distinctions. 

	The problems with this theory is that if everything needs to be verified scientifically, then how do we verify this theory itself? How do we scientifically verify the statement of “We need to scientifically verify everything”? Also, how do we verify other statements such as “Murder is wrong”? We know that is a correct statement intuitively, but we cannot verify it by logic arguments, and it is not something we can see in the world. 
	
	
	\subsection{Paradigm Shift - Thomas Kuhn}
	Thomas Kuhn groups science into different paradigms. These paradigms are basically like environments with a certain set of assumptions, rules, problems, and solutions. 

	Over time, people will be doing normal science. This is where scientists have some problems that need to be solved and they solve these problems within the current paradigm using the current rules and assumptions. This works quite well until we get to a problem that cannot be solved in the current paradigm (with the current rules, and perspective). This is called an anomaly, which is an inconsistency in the paradigm. Often we ignore or come up with an explanation for the first few anomalies until they get too big to be ignored. Then once the problems are too big to be ignored, and start to prevent solving multiple scientific problems, we enter a crisis in the paradigm. 

	Then once we are in a crisis, we will have a scientific revolution which will replace the old paradigm with a new and improved paradigm. This can have new rules, new assumptions, and new ways of thinking. Then we are back into the normal science but now in this new paradigm (environment).

	This cycle continues on until the next crisis.
	
	
	\subsection{Martin Heidegger}
	A device is called available if we use the device, and do not think about us using the device, such as a hammer, or a car. These devices are meaningless. 
	
	Technology causes people to lose all meaning since we use it for everything. 
	
	Technology is a mode of revealing. For example, we have energy in the air and the windmill reveals that energy. Something like art is not actually created, it has always existed, it was just existing hidden in the mind. Technology allows that art to be revealed so we can see it. 
	
	In modern times, we do not exactly use technology to naturally reveal stuff. We challenge forth the hidden things from nature. We think as nature as a standing reserve of energy, and that it is there to be used, and challenged. For example, in previous times we would simply burn fuel to create heat. Now we challenge this fuel to get the most energy possible from it to run an ICE. Even the act of getting in the future now involves complex technology to extract oil from the ground, or to efficiently chop down forests when talking about wood. 

	Modern technology wants to categorize into boxes that can be controlled and challenge nature which causes individualism to be removed. 
	
	
	\subsection{Albert Borgmann}
	Borgmann is a middle ground between technology determinism and technology as an instrument.

	He believes that technology alienates humans from reality. He thinks of technology as being paradigm based. It is a framework to do science. One paradigm is premodern technology, and another one is modern technology. He does not care about what technology is, only its impact on society. 

	We cannot live without technology, but we can pick focal devices which allow us to have meaning in our lives such as running. We can still use technology in our lives, but we can focus on running. 

	In the past we had to chop wood, and stoke the fire. This gave us meaning and a relationship with nature, and other people to organize all of this. Now we are spoiled with automatic systems, so we don’t have to worry about this. We are disengaged with reality. 

	People are consumers because we are detached from reality.

	People can be couch potatoes since they don’t really have to engage with reality `at all.
	
	
	\section{Midterm 1 Practice Questions}
	
	\subsection{Explain the differences between how the Greeks viewed technology, vs how modern society view technology.}
	
	Greeks viewed technology as complementing nature. Now we see technology as opposing nature. In the time of the greeks, they thought as nature as divine. Nature was this very important thing that we all should learn to imitate. Technology was seen as something that would complement and improve nature. The Greeks thought of technology as imitating nature such as how a house would imitate how animals in nature build nests, and traps would imitate spider webs. Their line of thinking with a house would be that the base idea is a bird nest which is found in nature. Then the humans would improve it by adding a roof, adding a door, and other things to make it better. 
	Nowadays we think of technology as opposing nature. We think of nature as things such as birds, lions, trees, and grass. We think of technology such as farming, and building as destroying animals habitats, and destroying trees and land. We also think of technology such as computers using lots of electricity which also destroys nature.
	
	\subsection{Come up with a definition of technology.}
	Technology is anything that is created by humans, or something that has already been created by humans, for the purpose of doing something, making something easier, or entertainment. 
	
	This definition includes many things that we know to be technology such as computers since computers exist for all three of my points. They “do something”, make life easier, and can be used for entertainment. Saddles for horses were invented by humans for the purpose of more easily riding horses. Hammers were invented to more easily apply forces to objects. Saws were invented for more easily cutting certain materials. Even Art is classified as technology through this definition since Art is for entertainment. It also includes items made by items made by humans, such as an art piece made by Artificial Intelligence, or a binary program file compiled by a computer. Something like a water bottle, or a plate are also classified as technology since they were both invented by humans in order to make it easier to satisfy the basic human need of food and water. 
	
	Many things we know not to be technology are not included in this definition such as cows, trees, and the ground. This is because none of these were created by humans or by something made by humans. These all existed for a long time and would still have existed even without humans ever existing. If I was to go into a forest where no human had ever been, we can all agree that that is nature. My definition also says that is nature since none of that was created by humans. 
	
	\subsection{Is there any inconsistency with Bacon's “Subduing nature by shaking it to its bones”?}
	Bacon mentions that we need to obey nature’s laws in order to subdue it. What he means by that is that in order to conquer and overcome nature, we need to first know how it works. For example, in order to cut down a tree to get the wood, which can be used to build houses, tools, or many other items, we first need to understand the physics. If we do not know that, we will cut down a tree and it will fall in any direction, potentially on the person cutting it down. Another more modern example is computers. To make the computers, which overcomes nature in so many ways, we first needed to understand physics. At the base level, computers are just physics. The directions and behaviour of electrons define how a MOSFET transistor works. Transistors are what the logic gates in a computer are made of, and these logic gates build the whole computer. 
	
	Even once we have the computer built, we still need to know how to follow logic laws to make the programs that run on these computers. 
	
	Another thing Bacon mentions is the theory of the idols. Since there are naturally all the 4 idols such as the idol of the cave, idol of the tribe, idol of the marketplace, and idol of the theater, these are all things that we must understand in order to conquer them. The first step in overcoming a preexisting bias is to understand that it exists. Here we are understanding that these four idols (biasses) exist in the human mind by nature, and we can therefore conquer them and reduce their effect on our scientific research. 
	
	In conclusion there is no real inconsistency in Bacon’s statement of having to understand and obey nature in order to conquer it and “shake it to its bones”.
	
	\subsection{Write about the good and bad effects of technology on humans. How does technology improve things, and how does technology erode human values?}
	Technology has a large impact on humans, and this impact has both positive and negative impacts. The main impact of technology is to improve efficiency. We see this all the time in real life. When we need to get somewhere, we can drive, or take the bus, or even fly. This means we are able to meet people from all over the world. If this technology did not exist, people would have never been able to discover other nations. Canada would be full of people whose ancestry is Canadian, Europe would be full of people whose ancestry is European, and so on. Now we have people from all over the world in Canada and other countries around the world. It also increases efficiency with manufacturing allowing us to have many luxuries improving quality of life such as computers, smartphones, and so on. 

	Technology also provides basic necessities to the vast majority of people such as food, water, and shelter. In the past, people would make a shelter out of sticks and leaves which would get destroyed during a storm. It would have taken an enormous amount of effort from a large number of individuals to make any large sturdy structure. (Building a large structure could be argued is technology as well). It would have taken such effort that only a small percentage of the population would have been able to get a sturdy shelter. Now we can build a strong sturdy building in as little as a few days by a single person if needed depending on the size and complexity of the building (considering a small shed, this can be done by one person in a few days). It also allows everyone to have food, and especially the correct types of food year long. In the past, it would have been challenging to get vegetables and fruits in the colder months due to them not growing. Now we can easily get them due to shipping, and fridges. Even water is much easier to get as we can pump it from a water source all the way across the country to people’s houses. 

	Despite all of technologies benefits with efficiency, we have to think of the hidden costs of this efficiency. This is actually quite visible especially over the past few years with the rise of generative AI. One example is if we purchase a product and it is defective, and we require support, we often have to go through an AI bot to get support. While a good human would likely realize the mistake and provide a replacement product as should be done, the AI bot may not as it has different values than humans. Humans are compassionate beings, and AI is just made to follow instructions. This shows that technology erodes human values such as compassion, and justice. Another example is that even with driving, we often spend so much time driving around, which is more efficient, but is that really what we want to do in our free time? 

	One huge point is that these technologies erode our freedom. Nowadays, we cannot practically drive to a location in the middle of nowhere, and camp for a month. If we do this, we will miss bills due dates, potentially miss important letters in the mail such as jury summons, as well as jobs would not likely allow this. This shows that technology really erodes the sense of freedom that humans have. We are bound by this technology so we may not be able to do what we truly want to do. 
	
	Another very recent example is modern safety equipment on cars. In the past, we could take a car and drive wherever we want, do whatever maneuvers we want, and the car would follow our instructions. Now the car has many advanced safety features that are meant to improve safety using technology, but as a side effect, the car no longer always will follow the instructions of the driver. For example, if I press the gas pedal, and the car senses an item in front of the car, it will press the brakes without me doing so. Regardless of the intentions of the car, this has reduced the freedom of the user. Then are we really the ones driving the car or is it a machine doing most of the hard work? An analogy is where young people go shopping with their parents and then are proud of going shopping. At the end of the day, the parents were still the ones making all the important decisions. They were just trying to make the child feel good about them being supposedly independent. Is this is what is going on with cars where the car is trying to make the driver feel in control when all the strings are really being pulled by the machine?

	These technologies also erode peoples creativity. In the past before technology, people came up with ideas that were truly their own. Now, often people see something online, or talk about something with someone from a different part of town, and then come up with an idea. Is this idea truly their own? Or is the idea just copied from what they saw online, or from this other person from a different part of town?
	
	
	\section{Midterm 2 Practice Questions}
	\subsection{What is the difference between synthetic apriority and analytic apriority?}
	An analytic statement means by definition it can be found to be true. So for example all bachelors are unmarried is by definition. Synthetic means just the way the world is. So this is something like every event has a cause. The way the world is, every event has a cause. A priori means we know it without experience and observation, just by prior knowledge. So both above statements are a priori since we don’t have to test in order to confirm that it is true, we know it is true before observing it in real life. 
	
	\subsection{What is the debate between logical positivism and Immanuel Kant?}
	This debates whether or not a statement can be both synthetic and a priori. Kant says that a statement can be either analytic a priori, synthetic a posteriori, or some statements can be synthetic a priori. This means the statement can be known without observation, but it is not by definition. An example is the statement 7+4=11. The definition of 7+4 is not 11. But we can logically reason that it is 11 without taking 7 apples, and 4 apples, and counting 11. If we are however using logical positism, this would end up likely being classified as analytic a priori. 
	
	\subsection{What is the process of the paradigm shift?}
	We have paradigms, this is an environment with its own set of rules, and assumptions for science. This is very similar to the aspect of containerization used in computers. For example, I host some websites and services myself. I tend to seperate these into containers that each have their own operating system with their own dependancies, paths, and access to their own resources. Paradigms are similar in that they have their own rules and assumptions for science. The process of paradigm shift is where we start with normal science which has a paradigm called A. We have rules and assumtions associated with A. Scientific problems appear and we solve them using the rules and assumptions of A. Then an anomaly appears, this is a problem that cannot be solved in this environment A. We often will either explain or ignore this anomaly. This goes on until there are too many anomalies to ignore or explain away. Now we have a real problem on our hands, the current paaradigm rules are not enough to solve the problems. So we enter a crisis. Here we change the viewpoint and rules to new ones. Now we are in a new paradigm with new rules and new assumptions that can solve the previous anomalies. This then becomes the new normal science and continues until we find a bunch more anomalies, then get a crisis, and then have another scientific revolution to get to a new paradigm, and repeat again. 
	
	\subsection{What are the two objections of the principle of verification?}
	The principle of verification means that every statement must be scientifically verified in order to have meaning. The two objections are firstly, there are some statements that we know have meaning but they cannot be verified. For example, how do we verify the statement that murder is wrong? Or theft is wrong? We cannot really verdify that something is “wrong”. We can verify that people are sad after a murder, but that does not necessarily make it wrong. We are sad at a funeral but that does not make a funeral wrong. The other main objection is that if all statement need to be verified scientifically, how do we verify that claim itself? Meaning, how do we verify the claim that “All claims need to be verified or the claim is meaningless”? If we cannot verify that claim (which we cannot), then that claim is meaningless which breaks the whole thing. 
	
	\subsection{What is borgmanns views?}
	Borgmann thinks that technology is everywhere and we cannot really escape it. He thinks that technology takes away our connection with reality. In the past, we had to do a lot of work. Now we trade this work for consumption. So when we are driving, we are consuming fuel. We are not actually doing anything in real life. There is a disconnect between the real world and what we are currently doing. He thinks that we need focus things which are things that connect us to reality such as running. Here we are doing physical work, but we are also getting something done. 
	
	
	\subsection{What does heidegger say about premodern vs modern technology?}
	Heidegger thinks that modern technology is not good. Modern technology takes away the meaning of life since we do not think about all the devices that we use in our day to day life. We think of these devices and technology as just a standing reserve of resources whether that is thinking of trees as just a heat source (to burn), animals as just a food source (to eat), or lakes as just a sustenance source (to drink and clean). We do not actually think about anything which would cause us to lose touch with reality. We try to think of everything as just a resource and remove all the meaning from items, and just categorize them as some sort of resource. We challenge forth the resources from a thing. For example, take a cow. We raise this cow in an enclosure, then put it in a barn to eat food until it gets big and fat. Then we kill the cow and get the meat. We are shaping this cow, challenging it, to become a resource for us to eat. Heidegger thinks that premodern technology was simply a form of revealing the true nature of an item. When we burn wood for a fire, we reveal that it is actually heat. When we grow a cow, we think of the cow as always having been there, we just raise it to grow up. Modern technology is similar to premodern technology, but taken to an extreme to only view these items as a standing reserve of resources.
