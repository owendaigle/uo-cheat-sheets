well just for completion, here are the other courses that I took but did not make/publish cheat sheets for for some reason or another.

- HS courses - well I did not make many cheat sheets in HS, but I guess I could publish the few I did, but quite seriously, they probably have some copywright problems as I copy pasted a lot unfortunately. But I have learned since then...
- CHM1311 - I suck at chemistry, I had no idea what I was doing for this course but somehow ended up doing not terribly
- ITI1120 - This was just an introduction to python that a computer engineering student for some reason had to take. It was all common sense to me. I did not study for anyting and I got A+.
- PHY1124 - Well I sucked at this course, the prof did not work well with me, I went into the final with like a 60% in the course, and somehow brought it all the way to an A-. So I did not make a cheat sheet for this course before the final since I just had no idea about any of the theory (or so I thought)
- ENG1112 - English report writing, this was a very easy course that was just about "can you write reports" and "can you speak engrish" (often I cannot speak english online since I literally do not care about grammar, but when I actually care, I am fine)
- ELG2911 - Weird course, just about ethics, did not really see a point for cheat sheet. Also no final exam
